# LinuxDevConfig
A vendor agnostic shell script to configurate a development environment in a Linux distribution 

## Motivation
It's a pain to setup a development environment when you are constantly distro hopping (specially if you switch to a distro with a different package manager). The idea of this project is to make the setup smoother.

## Running the config script
```
./devconfig.sh
```
